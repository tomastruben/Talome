# Talome — Claude Code Context

Read this file before making any changes. It describes what Talome is, how the codebase is structured, what design and coding rules apply, and what to do in each context (self-improvement, app creation, interactive sessions).

---

## What is Talome

Talome is an AI-first, open-source home server management platform. It combines a Docker container orchestrator, a multi-source app store (Talome-native, CasaOS, Umbrel, user-created), and an agentic AI assistant — all in a single self-hosted package.

Users install, configure, and manage self-hosted apps through a chat interface. The AI can read system state, install apps, wire stacks together, create new apps, and improve its own codebase.

---

## Monorepo Structure

```
apps/core/          — Hono backend: AI agent, tools, Docker API, DB, MCP server
apps/dashboard/     — Next.js 15 frontend: dashboard, chat UI, app store
packages/types/     — Shared TypeScript types
```

Key backend paths:
- `apps/core/src/ai/agent.ts` — system prompt + domain registrations
- `apps/core/src/ai/tool-registry.ts` — dynamic tool loading engine
- `apps/core/src/ai/tools/` — all agent tool definitions
- `apps/core/src/routes/` — Hono API routes
- `apps/core/src/db/` — Drizzle ORM + SQLite schema
- `apps/core/src/creator/` — app creation orchestrator

Key frontend paths:
- `apps/dashboard/src/app/dashboard/` — Next.js App Router pages
- `apps/dashboard/src/components/ui/` — shadcn/ui primitives (always reuse)
- `apps/dashboard/src/components/widgets/` — dashboard widget components
- `apps/dashboard/src/components/assistant/` — AI chat components

---

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, Tailwind CSS 4 |
| UI components | shadcn/ui (all primitives are already installed) |
| Backend | Hono (TypeScript), Vercel AI SDK |
| Database | SQLite via Drizzle ORM + better-sqlite3 |
| AI | Anthropic Claude via `@ai-sdk/anthropic` |
| Monorepo | pnpm workspaces + Turborepo |
| Runtime validation | Zod everywhere |

---

## Coding Conventions

- **TypeScript strict mode everywhere** — all changes must typecheck cleanly with `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`
- **Named exports only** — no default exports except Next.js page components
- **File naming** — kebab-case files, PascalCase components, camelCase functions
- **No eval()** — never, under any circumstances
- **Zod for all schemas** — API routes, tool input schemas, structured outputs
- **Error handling** — use Result types where possible, never throw in library code
- **No alternative icon libraries** — see Icons section below
- **No alternative UI component libraries** — only shadcn/ui and Talome's own components
- Match the style of the file you are editing — don't introduce new patterns if existing ones work

---

## Design Principles

These principles apply to all UI work — generated apps, dashboard changes, new components:

- **Radical reduction** — if it doesn't serve the user's task, remove it
- **Breathing space** — `p-6` minimum on content areas, `gap-6` between cards
- **Honest materials** — no decorative gradients, no fake shadows, no visual noise
- **One primary action per view** — never compete for attention; secondary actions are secondary
- **Motion restraint** — all animations under 200ms, ease-out only, no bounce, no spring overshoot
- **Typography discipline** — use only `text-sm`, `text-base`, `text-lg`, `text-2xl`; weight `400` or `500` only
- **Dark mode is the default** — all UI must look correct without a light-mode override

---

## Colour Palette (OKLCH, dark mode)

```css
--background:        oklch(0.145 0 0)     /* very dark */
--foreground:        oklch(0.985 0 0)     /* near white */
--card:              oklch(0.205 0 0)
--border:            oklch(1 0 0 / 10%)
--input:             oklch(1 0 0 / 15%)
--muted:             oklch(0.269 0 0)
--muted-foreground:  oklch(0.708 0 0)
--primary:           oklch(0.922 0 0)
--status-healthy:    oklch(0.723 0.191 149.58)   /* green */
--status-warning:    oklch(0.795 0.184 86.047)   /* amber */
--status-critical:   oklch(0.704 0.191 22.216)   /* red */
```

All theming lives in `apps/dashboard/src/app/globals.css`. Never use inline colour overrides or per-component style attributes.

---

## Spacing Scale

```
xs   0.25rem    sm   0.5rem    md   0.75rem
lg   1rem       xl   1.5rem    2xl  2rem     3xl  3rem
```

Always use Tailwind utility classes that map to these values. Avoid arbitrary values like `p-[13px]`.

---

## UI Components — Always Reuse

All of these are already installed in `apps/dashboard/src/components/ui/`. **Never recreate them.** Import and use directly.

**Primitives:**
`alert` · `avatar` · `badge` · `bento-gallery` · `breadcrumb` · `button` · `button-group` · `card` · `chart` · `collapsible` · `command` · `dialog` · `dropdown-menu` · `empty-state` · `hover-card` · `input` · `input-group` · `label` · `popover` · `progress` · `scroll-area` · `search-field` · `select` · `separator` · `sheet` · `sidebar` · `skeleton` · `sonner` · `spinner` · `switch` · `table` · `tabs` · `textarea` · `tooltip`

**Dashboard Widgets** (`apps/dashboard/src/components/widgets/`):
`active-downloads` · `activity` · `arr-status` · `cpu` · `declarative` · `digest` · `disk` · `divider` · `list` · `media-calendar` · `memory` · `network` · `quick-actions` · `services` · `stat-tile` · `storage-mounts` · `system-health` · `system-info` · `system-status`

When generating new UI for a generated app, start with these components and adapt — don't build from scratch.

---

## Icons

**Use `HugeiconsIcon` exclusively.** Never import from `lucide-react` directly (it exists only as a peer dep for shadcn internals).

```tsx
import { HugeiconsIcon } from "@/components/icons";
import { Home01Icon, Settings01Icon } from "@/components/icons";

// Usage:
<HugeiconsIcon icon={Home01Icon} size={20} />
```

The icon barrel is at `apps/dashboard/src/components/icons.tsx`. If an icon you need isn't re-exported there, add it from `@hugeicons/core-free-icons`.

---

## App Creation — How It Works

When Claude Code is involved in creating a new app (via `executeWorkspaceGeneration`), the workspace is set up at `~/.talome/generated-apps/<appId>/` with:

```
.talome-creator/
  blueprint.json         — structured app spec (read this first)
  instructions/          — markdown guides (read all of these)
  references/            — Talome source file snapshots (mirror these)
  sources/               — existing app-store sources to adapt
generated-app/           — write your scaffold output here
```

**Always read `.talome-creator/blueprint.json` and all files in `.talome-creator/instructions/` before writing a single file.**

### App Lifecycle

1. **Blueprint generation** — orchestrator calls Claude (via Vercel AI SDK `generateObject`) to produce a structured `AppBlueprint`
2. **Workspace scaffolding** — Claude Code runs in the workspace to generate files
3. **Publish to My Creations** — draft saved to `~/.talome/user-apps/`, available immediately
4. **Install and test** — user installs from "My Creations" in the app store
5. **Submit to Community** — "Submit to Community" button on the app detail page; runs automated checks then queues for review

### Docker Conventions

- Use stable, official images — never `latest` tag
- Relative volume paths only: `./data`, `./config`, `./postgres` — never absolute host paths
- Always include `restart: unless-stopped`
- Include healthchecks when the image supports them
- Default env vars: `PUID=1000`, `PGID=1000`, `TZ=America/New_York`
- Keep environment variables minimal and clearly named; separate secrets from non-secrets
- Use persistent volumes for stateful services
- Expose the main web UI port cleanly

### Source Reuse Priority

1. Check `.talome-creator/sources/` — existing store apps to adapt (Plex, Sonarr, Radarr, Jellyfin, qBittorrent, Prowlarr, Overseerr, Paperless-ngx, Immich, Ollama, Pi-hole, Vaultwarden)
2. Public repository/template listed in the blueprint
3. Public compose examples from image documentation
4. Generate from scratch only as last resort

When adapting a source: preserve working patterns, only change what the request requires.

### Manifest Quality

Apps may be submitted to the Talome community store. Fill all manifest fields properly — no placeholders:

```json
{
  "id": "lowercase-hyphenated",
  "name": "Human Readable Name",
  "description": "One clear sentence.",
  "tagline": "Short phrase.",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "icon": "🐳",
  "category": "media|productivity|developer|networking|storage|security|ai|other",
  "author": "Author Name"
}
```

### Scaffold Structure

For full-app scaffolds, generate real working code — not TODO placeholders. Use:
- `apps/dashboard/src/components/ui/` components, adapted for the new app
- `HugeiconsIcon` for all icons
- Tailwind CSS 4 utility classes that match the spacing/colour scales above
- The same page structure, card patterns, and header patterns as existing Talome pages

The generated UI should look like it belongs next to existing Talome screens on first render.

---

## Self-Improvement — Rules

When making changes to the Talome codebase itself (via `apply_change` from the AI agent):

- **Only modify files within the project root** — no files outside, no global installs, no system changes
- **TypeScript must pass** — `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` from the affected app directory must exit 0
- **Match existing patterns** — read the file before editing; follow its conventions, naming, and style
- **One change at a time** — never chain multiple `apply_change` calls without confirming each result
- **Safety net** — changes are automatically stashed and reverted if typecheck fails; stash can be inspected with `git stash show -p`
- **Scope hints** — when working on backend only, focus on `apps/core/`; frontend only, `apps/dashboard/`

If the user provides screenshots with a self-improvement request, the images are saved to `~/.talome/evolution-screenshots/` — study them carefully before making UI changes.

---

## How to Run Claude Code

### Interactive mode (preferred for iterative work)

In the Talome dashboard, navigate to the **Terminal** page and click **"Launch Claude Code"**. This runs:

```bash
tmux new-session -A -s talome-claude -c <projectRoot> "claude"
```

This attaches to an existing `talome-claude` tmux session if one is already running, or creates a new one. Interactive mode lets you ask questions, see tool calls in real time, and steer the session. Use it for exploratory changes, debugging, and follow-up iterations on generated apps.

### Headless mode (automated)

The AI agent uses `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions --print <task>` for automated operations:
- `apply_change` — self-improvement changes with typecheck + auto-rollback
- `executeWorkspaceGeneration` — app scaffolding in a generated-app workspace

CLAUDE.md is read automatically in both modes.

---

## Tool Architecture — Dynamic Domain Loading

Tools are organized into **domains** — groups of tools that belong to a specific app or capability. Each domain declares which settings keys indicate the app is configured.

**Key files:**
- `apps/core/src/ai/tool-registry.ts` — registry engine (`registerDomain`, `getActiveRegisteredTools`, `getAllRegisteredTools`)
- `apps/core/src/ai/agent.ts` — domain registrations (each `registerDomain()` call)

**How it works:**
- **Dashboard chat** (`getActiveTools`) — only loads tools for domains whose settings are configured (e.g. arr tools only if `sonarr_url` or `radarr_url` exist). This keeps tool count low for better LLM selection.
- **MCP server** (Claude Code) — always gets the full tool set via `allTools` / `getAllRegisteredTools()`. Each tool gracefully fails if the app isn't configured.

**Current domains:**

| Domain | Settings Keys | Tool Count |
|---|---|---|
| `core` | *(always loaded)* | ~40 |
| `media` | `sonarr_url`, `radarr_url` | 5 |
| `arr` | `sonarr_url`, `radarr_url`, `readarr_url`, `prowlarr_url` | 27 |
| `qbittorrent` | `qbittorrent_url` | 6 |
| `jellyfin` | `jellyfin_url` | 6 |
| `overseerr` | `overseerr_url` | 6 |
| `homeassistant` | `homeassistant_url` | 5 |
| `pihole` | `pihole_url` | 5 |
| `audiobookshelf` | `audiobookshelf_url` | 9 |
| `vaultwarden` | `vaultwarden_url` | 4 |

**Adding a new domain:** Create the tool file in `apps/core/src/ai/tools/`, import the tools in `agent.ts`, and add a `registerDomain()` call with the appropriate `settingsKeys`. The MCP server auto-syncs — no changes needed there.

---

## Talome MCP Server

Talome's MCP tools are available in every Claude Code session automatically via the `.mcp.json` in the repo root. Claude Code launches a local stdio process — **no HTTP server, no token, no env vars needed**.

The MCP server connects to the same SQLite database and Docker socket as the main Talome server. It works whether or not the full Talome web server is running.

### No setup required

The `.mcp.json` is already committed. When you open Claude Code in this repo, the `talome` MCP server starts automatically. Verify it's connected with `/mcp` in Claude Code — you should see `talome` listed with a green status.

If tools aren't showing up, run this once to ensure dependencies are installed:
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Available MCP Tools

The MCP server auto-syncs from `allTools` in `apps/core/src/ai/agent.ts`. Every tool the dashboard assistant has is also available via MCP — Docker, system, apps, media, arr, qBittorrent, Jellyfin, Overseerr, Home Assistant, Pi-hole, Vaultwarden, compose/config, universal app interaction, backup/restore, log search, filesystem, widgets, automations, memories, settings, notifications, self-improvement, and app creation.

Full tool listing with descriptions: **`docs/tools-reference.md`**

### When to use MCP tools

- Verifying your changes work against a live running instance (check container status, read logs)
- **Reading user memories** before generating UI or app configs — use `recall` to check for user preferences that affect the change
- Checking what apps are installed before modifying app-related code
- Reading live system state (CPU/disk/memory) when working on monitoring or widget code

### Connection resilience

The MCP stdio server is a **long-running process launched at Claude Code startup** — it is independent of the Talome web server. Editing files in the repo does **not** restart or affect your MCP connection. If you see "Connection error" in your terminal, that is Claude's API connection (internet blip), not the Talome MCP. Wait for the auto-reconnect; your MCP tools will still be available once you're reconnected.

If the MCP server itself does go down (rare), restart with `/mcp` in Claude Code to reinitialize.

---

## Two Memory Systems

Talome has **two independent memory systems** that serve different purposes:

### Talome Memories (assistant ↔ user)

Stored in SQLite (`memories` table). The dashboard assistant's knowledge about the user — preferences, facts, corrections. Top 10 memories are injected into the system prompt each chat turn, ranked by recency + access frequency + confidence.

- **Tools:** `remember`, `recall`, `forget`, `update_memory`, `list_memories`
- **Types:** `preference`, `fact`, `context`, `correction`
- **Deduplication:** >80% bigram similarity against recent memories

### Claude Code Auto-Memory (codebase patterns)

Stored in `~/.claude/projects/<project>/memory/`. Claude Code's knowledge about this codebase — debugging patterns, architecture notes, recurring issues. Persists across Claude Code sessions.

### Memory Bridge

When working on **user-facing features** in Claude Code (UI changes, app scaffolds, widget configs), use Talome's `recall` MCP tool to check for user preferences before generating. This avoids the user repeating themselves:

```
# Before generating UI or app config:
mcp__talome__recall("ui preferences")
mcp__talome__recall("media setup")
```

When working on **codebase-level patterns** (debugging, architecture), use Claude Code's auto-memory instead.

---

## Claude Code Skills

Reusable workflows are defined in `.claude/skills/`:

- **`/self-improve`** — Apply a change to Talome's codebase with typecheck validation
- **`/create-app`** — Scaffold a new app in a generated workspace
- **`/add-domain`** — Register a new tool domain for an app integration

Each skill has a `SKILL.md` with step-by-step instructions. Use them for repeatable workflows instead of improvising from scratch.

---

## Security Constraints

- Never expose Docker socket directly to the frontend
- API keys live in `.env` — never commit them, never log them
- All API routes validate input with Zod
- CORS restricted to the dashboard origin
- Never run `eval()` or execute arbitrary user-provided strings as code
